Many people are seeking stability in is unstable crypto space and  A lot of people are wondering if now 

is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now.

I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, 

that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack 

up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life That being said, the market is still all 

about BTC at the moment and I�ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Crypto 

Diego program, an established company that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the 

crypto space, to help them recover the loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, 

with their program I went from having 1.4btc to 12btc in just 9 weeks.
